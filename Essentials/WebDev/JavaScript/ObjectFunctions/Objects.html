    <h1>Objects in javascript</h1>
    <p>
      1. Objects are variables that store more than one value <br />
      2. Objects are used to store data in key-value pairs <br />
      3. Objects are mutable, meaning they can be changed after they are created
      <br />
      4. We use dot notation (.) or [] notation to access values inside the
      object<br />
      5. We use for... in loop to iterate through objects
    </p>
